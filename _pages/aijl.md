### 2084: Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Humanity -- John Lennox

Another title from Dr. Lennox that I thoroughly enjoyed reading back in 2020. This book presents some of the dangers posed by AGI if not leashed properly with proper ethics in place. The author discusses ideas that prove human creativity is far beyond the reach of AGI. Dr. Lennox explains how complex the human body is, along with the patterns that our brain is capable of picking up from the surroundings. I would highly recommend this title if you enjoy reading in the God and Technology genre.
