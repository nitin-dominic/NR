Can Science Explain Everything? by John Lennox

Dr. Lennox is one of my favorite writers who thinks critically and presents thoughtful evidence about the presence of God behind this universe. Being a mathematician, I love how he takes both his science and God seriously! Dr. Lennox has penned this book very thoughtfully. It's difficult for me to summarize the whole here because he has presented numerous theories and pieces of evidence for the existence of God.

Based on the gist of this book, people often misunderstand that science and religion do not mix and tend to think that science has all the answers. But it's not true as far as I see this book describes. It takes us on a journey from different worldviews being considered (in terms of giving an absolute answer about objective morality and the origin of the universe) and then explains why Christianity stands as the only religion after several tests. Dr. Lennox presents those thoughts very logically and with a touch of rationality.

The last chapter's heading was "Entering the Laboratory: Testing the truth of Christianity," which was very motivating to read. It is a must-read for all avid readers
