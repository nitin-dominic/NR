description: This page hosts a collection of books I have read so far. The reviewed title are the ones that I thoroughly enjoyed reading. I picked up reading habit at the age of 19 when the first book I read was titled, *Relentless - The Power You Need to Never Give* Up by *John Bevere*. Since then I have been highly interested in reading genres that include God and Science, Science and Technology, Early Church Fathers and how they shaped Catholic theology and Church teachings, and Christian Apologetics. I am not fond of reading science fiction at all and hardly recall reading one.

    content: Grand Weaver by Dr. Ravi Zacharias is one of my favorites. I read this book back in 2017 and enjoyed reading it.

    This book is mostly about Dr. Ravi's testimony and how God shaped his life thorugh trials and suffering. This is a great read for someone who is in the midst of suffering/trials but do not want to loose hope in God. This book will definitely help you understand life's suffereing through God's lenses thereby rekindling or stirring up the passion to serve him more.
