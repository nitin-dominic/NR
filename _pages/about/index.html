To address these operations, I integrate advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques with the data obtained from various ground and aerial-robots to accomplish site-specific needs. With over six years of research expertise, I am proficient in Python, skilled in data visualization using RStudio, possess theoretical and applied understanding of AI algorithms. I have a track record of publishing research findings in top-tier journals, coupled with strong communication skills and the ability to thrive in a fast-paced environment. Overall, I am blessed to work on cutting-edge research while hoping to lay a foundation for incoming researchers. I believe that the <strong>future of agriculture is data-driven</strong>. But what matters the most is how well do we <strong>manage</strong>, <strong>process</strong>, and <strong>interpret</strong> this data so that farmers, growers, stakeholders, agricultural technology providers, and extension educators could be benefitted from it. I strongly believe in the quote below:</p> <blockquote> <p>Data is the new currency but it will be useful when it is turned into action.</p> </blockquote> <hr> <h3 id="my-academic-background">My <strong>academic</strong> background</h3> <p>I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the <a href="https://www.ufl.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">University of Florida</a> - <a href="https://gcrec.ifas.ufl.edu/research-programs/center-for-artificial-intelligence/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Gulf Coast Research and Education Center (GCREC) and the Center for Applied AI</a>, supervised by <a href="https://crec.ifas.ufl.edu/people/faculty/arnold-schumann/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Arnold Schumann</a> and co-supervised by <a href="https://gcrec.ifas.ufl.edu/gcrec-facultystaff-directory/drnathanboyd/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Nathan Boyd</a>.
