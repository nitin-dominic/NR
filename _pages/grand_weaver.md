### Grand Weaver by Dr. Ravi Zacharias is one of my favorites. 

I read this book back in 2017 and enjoyed reading it. This book is mostly about Dr. Ravi's testimony and how God shaped his life thorugh trials and suffering. This is a great read for someone who is in the midst of suffering/trials but do not want to loose hope in God. This book will definitely help you understand life's suffereing through God's lenses thereby rekindling or stirring up the passion to serve him more.
