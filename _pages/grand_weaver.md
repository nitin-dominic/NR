### Grand Weaver: Ravi Zacharias

This book is one of my favorites. I read this title back in 2017 and since then it has been on my recommendation list. This book is basically Ravi's testimony and an his thoughts about God shaped his life through life's trials/suffering. I would highly suggest it to the readers who might be going through tough times and need a pinch of hope to re-stir their faith in God.
