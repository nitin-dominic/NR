### Data-driven agriculture

As an agricultural engineer working closely with precision agriculture technologies, I take a data-driven approach to visualize and monitor farming operations. To address these operations, I integrate artificial intelligence approaches with the data obtained from various ground and aerial-robots to address in-field and site-specific tasks in agriculture. Overall, I am blessed to work on cutting-edge research while hoping to lay a foundation for incoming researchers. I believe that the future of agriculture is data-driven. But what matters the most is how well do we manage, process, and interpret this data so that the farmers, stakeholders, agricultural technology providers (ATPs), and extension specialists could be benefitted from it. I strongly believe in the quote below:

> Data is the new currency but it will be useful when it is turned into action.

### My academic background

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering at North Dakota State University. I work in the NDSU Sun Lab and advised by Dr. Xin (Rex) Sun. Prior to this, I earned my masters degree in Agricultural Engineering with a specialization in Agricultural Systems and Management from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur, India. While my two years at the institute, I worked in the Soil Physics Lab and was advised by Prof. B. S. Das and co-advised by Dr. Rajendra Machavaram. I also hold a bachelors degree in Agricultural Engineering from Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences (SHUATS), India. You can find my extended CV [here](CV_Rai.pdf).

### Work philosophy

My work philosophies are inspired by Biblical heroes and their perspective towards life and calling with a purpose.
