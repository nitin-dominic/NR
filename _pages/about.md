### Data-driven agriculture

As an **agricultural engineer** working closely with precision agriculture technologies, I take a **data-driven** approach to visualize and monitor farming operations. To address these operations, I integrate artificial intelligence approaches with the data obtained from various ground and aerial-robots to address in-field and site-specific tasks in agriculture. Overall, I am blessed to work on cutting-edge research while hoping to lay a foundation for incoming researchers. I believe that the future of agriculture is data-driven. But what matters the most is how well do we **manage**, **process**, and **interpret** this data so that the farmers, stakeholders, agricultural technology providers, and extension specialists could be benefitted from it. I strongly believe in the quote below:

> Data is the new currency but it will be useful when it is turned into action.

### My academic background

I am a Postdoctoral Associate in the Department of [Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering](https://www.ndsu.edu/aben/) at [ND State University](https://www.ndsu.edu/). I earned my doctoral degree in Agriculturtal and Biosystems Engineering from ND State University in the [NDSU Sun Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/ndsusunslab) where I was advsied by [Dr. Xin (Rex) Sun](https://www.ndsu.edu/aben/faculty_and_staff/personnel/dr_xin_rex_sun/). Prior to this, I earned my master's degree in Agricultural Engineering with a specialization in Agricultural Systems and Management from the [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/), India. While my two years at the institute, I worked in the Soil Physics Lab and was advised by [Prof. B.S. Das](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?hl=en&user=oEvfFMYAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and co-advised by [Dr. Rajendra Machavaram](https://sites.google.com/site/rajendramachavaram/). I also hold a bachelor's degree in Agricultural Engineering from Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences [(SHUATS)](https://shuats.edu.in/), India. You can find my extended CV [here](CV_Rai.pdf).

### Work philosophy

My work philosophies are inspired by Biblical heroes and their perspective towards life and calling with a purpose.
