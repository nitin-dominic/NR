### **Data-driven** agriculture

As an **agricultural engineer** working closely with precision agriculture technologies, I take a **data-driven** approach to visualize and monitor farming operations. To address these operations, I integrate advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques with the data obtained from ground and aerial-robots to accomplish site-specific needs. 

With over 6+ years of experience in developing data-driven solutions for sustainable practices in precision agriculture, I specialize in both foundational and applied research in artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous systems for site-specific management in row and specialty crops. My expertise spans in-field data acquisition using autonomous ground and aerial robotic systems, the development of predictive AI models, and their deployment on edge platforms for real-time, closed-loop decision-making as part of on-farm research. This includes AI-driven perception, localization, and actuation for tasks such as targeted spraying. Overall, I am blessed to work on cutting-edge research while hoping to lay a foundation for incoming researchers. I believe the **future of agriculture** is fundamentally data-driven. However, the true value of data lies in how effectively we **manage**, **process**, and **interpret** it to generate actionable insights for farmers, growers, stakeholders, agricultural technology providers, and extension educators. I strongly believe in the following principle:

> Data is the new currency but it will be useful when it is turned into action.

### My **academic** background

I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the [University of Florida](https://www.ufl.edu/) - [Gulf Coast Research and Education Center (GCREC)](https://gcrec.ifas.ufl.edu/research-programs/center-for-artificial-intelligence/), supervised by [Prof. Arnold Schumann](https://crec.ifas.ufl.edu/people/faculty/arnold-schumann/) and co-supervised by [Prof. Nathan Boyd](https://gcrec.ifas.ufl.edu/gcrec-facultystaff-directory/drnathanboyd/). I previously served as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at [North Dakota State University](https://www.ndsu.edu/) (NDSU), where I worked on multiple projects spanning crop yield prediction and disease severity estimation in soybean and wheat using deep learning approaches. I obtained my doctoral degree in Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering at NDSU in 2023, working with [Dr. Xin (Rex) Sun](https://www.ndsu.edu/people/xin-rex-sun). Prior to this, I earned my master's degree in Agricultural and Food Engineering with a specialization in Agricultural Systems & Management from the [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/), India. While my two years at the institute, I worked in the [Soil Physics Lab](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/department/AG/faculty/ag-bsdas) and was advised by [Prof. B.S. Das](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?hl=en&user=oEvfFMYAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and co-advised by [Dr. R. Machavaram](https://sites.google.com/site/rajendramachavaram/). I also hold a bachelor's degree in Agricultural Engineering from Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences [(SHUATS)](https://shuats.edu.in/) (formerly, Allahabad Agricultural Institute), India.
