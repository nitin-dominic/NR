### **Data-driven** agriculture

As an **agricultural engineer** working closely with precision agriculture technologies, I take a **data-driven** approach to visualize and monitor farming operations. To address these operations, I integrate advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques with the data obtained from various ground and aerial-robots to accomplish site-specific needs. With over six years of research expertise, I am proficient in Python, skilled in data visualization using RStudio, possess theoretical and applied understanding of AI algorithms. I have a track record of publishing research findings in top-tier journals, coupled with strong communication skills and the ability to thrive in a fast-paced environment. Overall, I am blessed to work on cutting-edge research while hoping to lay a foundation for incoming researchers. I believe that the **future of agriculture is data-driven**. But what matters the most is how well do we **manage**, **process**, and **interpret** this data so that farmers, growers, stakeholders, agricultural technology providers, and extension educators could be benefitted from it. I strongly believe in the quote below:

> Data is the new currency but it will be useful when it is turned into action.

### My **academic** background

I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the [University of Florida](https://www.ufl.edu/) - [Gulf Coast Research and Education Center (GCREC) and the Center for Applied AI](https://gcrec.ifas.ufl.edu/research-programs/center-for-artificial-intelligence/), supervised by [Prof. Arnold Schumann](https://crec.ifas.ufl.edu/people/faculty/arnold-schumann/) and co-supervised by [Prof. Nathan Boyd](https://gcrec.ifas.ufl.edu/gcrec-facultystaff-directory/drnathanboyd/). I obtained my doctoral degree in Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering at ND State University in 2023, working with [Dr. Xin (Rex) Sun](https://www.ndsu.edu/aben/faculty_staff/dr_xin_rex_sun/). Prior to this, I earned my masters degree in Agricultural Engineering with a specialization in Agricultural Systems & Management from the [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/), India. While my two years at the institute, I worked in the [Soil Physics Lab](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/department/AG/faculty/ag-bsdas) and was advised by [Prof. B.S. Das](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?hl=en&user=oEvfFMYAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and co-advised by [Dr. R. Machavaram](https://sites.google.com/site/rajendramachavaram/). I also hold a bachelors degree in Agricultural Engineering from Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences [(SHUATS)](https://shuats.edu.in/) (formerly, Allahabad Agricultural Institute), India.
