### Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World: Cal Newport


In the present age of ADHD, I highly recommend this book! The book describes several rules for navigating your path to help you achieve more focus. Therefore, I'll categorize it as more of a self-help genre. 
It will ask you to take a few extreme steps, such as deleting your social media account among others. You could certainly do that to gain more focus at your workplace, but be aware of FOMO! ðŸ˜§

Keeping one aspect of social media aside, this book also presents some of the experiments conducted on humans to help better understand how we can achieve "deep work" that ultimately leads to more contribution to our careers.
