### Rebooting AI: Building Artificial Intelligence We Can Trust: Gary Marcus and Ernest Davis

One of the best titles I have read in the Science and Technology genre. As a researcher applying artificial intelligence (AI) to agricultural big datasets, this book helped me stretch my thoughts on how we can make AI more transparent and explainable to layman audiences. It's a great read for those who are either learning about AI techniques to analyze big data or are midway in applying these techniques already. The book will equip you to thoroughly reason why the AGI we talk about is still far away from human creativity and understanding of the world around us. It will also help you understand why and how the AI we encounter in our daily lives, be it a helping robot or a real-time monitoring device, needs data that the existing amount of annotated dataset cannot satiate.
