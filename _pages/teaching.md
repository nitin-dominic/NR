### PAG 315 - Electronic Systems in Precision Ag. (~ Spring 2024)
I am currently teaching this course in the Spring of 2024. This course comprises of 2-lectures (50 mins each) and 1-lab (1 hr 50 mins) each week. I am the sole instructor of this coursework where I teach students about various electrical components and devices used in Precision Ag. technologies. The labs are based on equipping students about the use of Arduino Microcontroller and programming interface while helping them understand the application of several APIs. Syllabus to this course can be found [here](PAG315ClassDoc.pdf). 

### PAG 115L - Introduction to Precision Ag. Lab (~ Fall 2023) 
I designed and taught a 3-week lab for this course. Lab contents included, use of open-source mapping software such as QGIS, subscription-based ArcGIS Pro, and automating spatial workflows in GIS using Python.
