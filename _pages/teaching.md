### PAG 315 - Electronic Systems in Precision Ag. (~ Spring 2024)
I am currently teaching this course in the Spring of 2024. This course comprises of 2-lectures (50 mins each) and 1-lab (1 hr 50 mins) each week. I am the sole instructor of this coursework where I teach students about various electrical components and devices used in Precision Ag. technologies. The labs are based on equipping students about the use of Arduino Microcontroller and programming interface. Syllabus to this course can be found [here](PAG315ClassDoc_Rai.pdf).
